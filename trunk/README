Kakaru - Jabber Bot written in C++

greets all

if u can help me, just tell:

mail: senu@o2.pl

i am pure object oriented programmer, so if sth is wrong, just tell...

QUESTIONS/BUGS/FEATURES:
if you wanna fast response, send me message by jabber. 

i ve tried to make class/variables/files names understandable, so i think 
you dont need any documentation :P
 
currently there is only kakaru.config files, so you must edit sources to change sth.

groups 		-> groups, rights, help, bot ovner
commands.cpp 	-> commands
bot.cpp 		-> resource name

oh if you wanna try working bot, add Agatka (agatka@jabber.autocom.pl) to you roster.

btw. small poll:
do you REALLY, REALLY, need abilty to add own commands, without editing commands.cpp?
well i can write small parser (eg. 

[commands.config]

COMMAND_ADD(3,"spam","/spam group","spams group")
{

	FOR $i=1 to 10 
	{ 
		SEND_TO_ALL($param0,"blah, blah, foo, bar")
		ADD_TO_LOG(NORMAL,"i spammed $_GROUP_NAME($param0)");
	} 
	DISCONNECT() 
}


)

but it will take too much code_time, and it will slow down Kakaru, so i need many requests to implement that parser. anyway you can request feature, if it is easy, you will get that in few hours.

btw send me yours bot_commands if you ve write any.
